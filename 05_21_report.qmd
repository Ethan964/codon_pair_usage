[^dataset]: Final-filtered-mut-netphos.csv

# Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a binary classification model capable of
predicting the target variable 'answer'. 

The initial modeling efforts focuses on the 'final-filtered-mut-netphos.csv'
dataset which contains continuous and categorical features relating to individual
gene sequences. This dataset spans over 40,000 rows long and 8 columns wide.

Key processing steps included:

+ Converting the target variable, answer, to binary format
+ Finding and excluding known features to cause leakage for certain iterations
of modeling (pos & score)
+ Encoding categorical variables
+ Dropping certain categorical variables deemed extremely rare to avoid 
overfitting and adding unnecessary complexity to the model
+ Identifying class imbalance and addressing this problem through various
oversampling techniques

Classification models were trained using an array of techniques. These include
plain logistic modeling, Random Forest, and XGBoost, with an emphasis on
high ROC AUC and F1 scores as evaluation metrics due to the inherent class 
imbalance. 

Additional datasets such as 'adj-filtered-rnafold-mut.tsv', 
'filtered-mut-codon-pair-usage.tsv', and others are queued for integration
following our primary modeling validation. 

This document summarizes the current modeling pipeline, data preprocessing, 
and preliminary insights from feature importance engineering efforts.


# Exploratory Analysis

This section covers the exploratory analysis performed on the dataset[^dataset].
It spans across my data cleaning efforts, familiarizing myself with dataset,
and exporing the relationships between each variable.
